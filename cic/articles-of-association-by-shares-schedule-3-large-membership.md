        l.  to such an extent;

        m.  in relation to such matters or territories; and

        n.  on such terms and conditions;

        committees, which prevail over rules derived from the Articles

    14. A Directors' meeting must be called by at least seven Clear

        3.  all the Directors agree; or

        4.  urgent circumstances require shorter notice.

    15. Notice of Directors' meetings must be given to each Director.

    16. Every notice calling a Directors' meeting must specify:

        5.  the place, day and time of the meeting; and

        6.  if it is anticipated that Directors participating in the
            meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed
            that they should communicate with each other during the
            meeting.

    18. Notice of Directors' meetings may be sent by Electronic Means to

    Directors' meetings**

    19. Subject to the Articles, Directors participate in a Directors'

        7.  the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance
            with the Articles; and

        8.  they can each communicate to the others any information or
            opinions they have on any particular item of the business of
            the meeting.

    20. In determining whether Directors are participating in a
        Directors' meeting, it is irrelevant where any Director is or
        how they communicate with each other.[^9]

    21. If all the Directors participating in a meeting are not in the
        same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be treated as
        taking place wherever any of them is.

16. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089532 .anchor}**Quorum for Directors'
    meetings**[^10]

    22. At a Directors' meeting, unless a quorum is participating, no
        proposal is to be voted on, except a proposal to call another
        meeting.

    23. The quorum for Directors' meetings may be fixed from time to
        time by a decision of the Directors, but it must never be less
        than two, and unless otherwise fixed it is \[two\].

    24. If the total number of Directors for the time being is less than
        the quorum required, the Directors must not take any decision
        other than a decision:

        9.  to appoint further Directors; or

        10. to call a general meeting so as to enable the shareholders
            to appoint further Directors.

17. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089533 .anchor}**Chairing of Directors'

    25. Questions arising at a Directors' meeting shall be decided by a
        majority of votes.

    27. In case of an equality of votes, the Chair shall have a second
        or casting vote.

19. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089535 .anchor}**Decisions without a
    meeting**[^13]

    28. The Directors may take a unanimous decision without a Directors'
        meeting by indicating to each other by any means, including
        without limitation by Electronic Means, that they share a common
        view on a matter. Such a decision may, but need not, take the
        form of a resolution in Writing, copies of which have been
        signed by each Director or to which each Director has otherwise
        indicated agreement in Writing.

    29. A decision which is made in accordance with Article 19.1 shall
        be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting
        duly convened and held, provided the following conditions are
        complied with:

        11. approval from each Director must be received by one person
            being either such person as all the Directors have nominated
            in advance for that purpose or such other person as
            volunteers if necessary ("the Recipient"), which person may,
            for the avoidance of doubt, be one of the Directors;

        12. following receipt of responses from all of the Directors,
            the Recipient must communicate to all of the Directors by
            any means whether the resolution has been formally approved
            by the Directors in accordance with this Article 19.2;

        13. the date of the decision shall be the date of the
            communication from the Recipient confirming formal approval;

        14. the Recipient must prepare a minute of the decision in
            accordance with Article 62.

20. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089536 .anchor}**Conflicts of
    interest**[^14]

    30. Whenever a Director finds himself or herself in a situation that
        is reasonably likely to give rise to a Conflict of Interest, he
        or she must declare his or her interest to the Directors unless,
        or except to the extent that, the other Directors are or ought
        reasonably to be aware of it already.

    31. Whenever a matter is to be discussed at a meeting or decided in
        accordance with Article 19 and a Director has a Conflict of
        Interest in respect of that matter then, subject to Article 21,
        he or she must:

        15. remain only for such part of the meeting as in the view of
            the other Directors is necessary to inform the debate;

        16. not be counted in the quorum for that part of the meeting;
            and

        17. withdraw during the vote and have no vote on the matter.

    32. If any question arises as to whether a Director has a Conflict
        of Interest, the question shall be decided by a majority
        decision of the other Directors.

    33. When a Director has a Conflict of Interest which he or she has
        declared to the Directors, he or she shall not be in breach of
        his or her duties to the Company by withholding confidential
        information from the Company if to disclose it would result in a
        breach of any other duty or obligation of confidence owed by him
        or her.

21. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089537 .anchor}**Directors' power to
    authorise a conflict of interest**

    34. The Directors have power to authorise a Director to be in a
        position of Conflict of Interest provided:

        18. in relation to the decision to authorise a Conflict of
            Interest, the conflicted Director must comply with Article
            20.3;

        19. in authorising a Conflict of Interest, the Directors can
            decide the manner in which the Conflict of Interest may be
            dealt with and, for the avoidance of doubt, they can decide
            that the Director with a Conflict of Interest can
            participate in a vote on the matter and can be counted in
            the quorum;

        20. the decision to authorise a Conflict of Interest can impose
            such terms as the Trustees think fit and is subject always
            to their right to vary or terminate the authorisation; and

    35. If a matter, or office, employment or position, has been
        authorised by the Directors in accordance with Article 21.1
        then, even if he or she has been authorised to remain at the
        meeting by the other Directors, the Director may absent himself
        or herself from meetings of the Directors at which anything
        relating to that matter, or that office, employment or position,
        will or may be discussed.

    36. A Director shall not be accountable to the Company for any
        benefit which he or she derives from any matter, or from any
        office, employment or position, which has been authorised by the
        Directors in accordance with Article 21.1 (subject to any limits
        or conditions to which such approval was subject).

22. []{#_Ref210023987 .anchor}**Register of Directors' interests**

> The Directors shall cause a register of Directors' interests to be
> kept. A Director must declare the nature and extent of any interest,
> direct or indirect, which he or she has in a proposed transaction or
> arrangement with the Company or in any transaction or arrangement
> entered into by the Company which has not previously been declared.

        o.  by ordinary resolution; or

        p.  by a decision of the Directors.

    39. In any case where, as a result of death, the Company has no
        shareholders and no Directors, the personal representatives of
        the last shareholder to have died have the right, by notice in
        Writing, to appoint a person to be a Director.

    40. For the purposes of Article 23.3, where 2 or more shareholders

        e.  the nominal value of those shares;

        f.  that the shares are fully paid; and

        j.  damaged or defaced; or

        k.  said to be lost, stolen or destroyed,

            that shareholder is entitled to be issued with a replacement
            certificate in respect of the same shares.

    56. A shareholder exercising the right to be issued with such a
        replacement certificate:

        l.  may at the same time exercise the right to be issued with a
            single certificate or separate certificates;

    57. Shares may be transferred by means of an instrument of
        transfer[^20] in any usual form or any other form approved by
        the Directors, which is executed by or on behalf of the
        transferor.

    58. No fee may be charged for registering any instrument of transfer
        or other Document relating to or affecting the title to any
        share.

    59. The Company may retain any instrument of transfer which is
        registered.

    60. The transferor remains the holder of a share until the
        transferee's name is entered in the register of shareholders as
        holder of it.

    61. The Directors may refuse to register the transfer of a share to
        a person of whom they do not approve.

    62. They may also refuse to register the transfer unless it is
        lodged at the registered office of the Company or at such other
        place as the Directors may appoint and is accompanied by such
        evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the
        right of the transferor to make the transfer, and by such other
        information, as they may reasonably require.

    63. If the Directors refuse to register such a transfer, they shall,
        within two months after the date on which the transfer was
        lodged with the Company send to the transferee notice of the
        refusal.

    64. The provisions of this Article apply in addition to any
        restrictions on the transfer of a share which maybe set out
        elsewhere in the Memorandum or Articles of the Company.

33. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089552 .anchor}**Purchase of own

    Subject to the articles, the Company may purchase its own shares
    (including any redeemable shares) and may make a payment in respect
    of the redemption or purchase of its own shares otherwise than out
    of the distributable profits of the Company or the proceeds of a
    fresh issue of shares. Any share so purchased shall be purchased at
    its nominal value.

34. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089553 .anchor}**Transmission of
    shares**[^22]

    65. If title to a share passes to a transmittee, the Company may
        only recognise the transmittee as having any title to that
        share.

    66. A transmittee who produces such evidence of entitlement to
        shares as the Directors may properly require:

        o.  may, subject to the Articles, choose either to become the
            holder of those shares or to have them transferred to
            another person; and

        p.  subject to the Articles, and pending any transfer of the
            shares to another person, has the same rights as the holder
            had.

    67. But transmittees do not have the right to attend or vote at a
        general meeting, or agree to a proposed written resolution, in
        respect of shares to which they are entitled, by reason of the
        holder's death or bankruptcy or otherwise, unless they become
        the holders of those shares.

35. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089554 .anchor}**Exercise of transmittees'
    rights**

    68. Transmittees who wish to become the holders of shares to which
        they have become entitled must notify the Company in Writing of
        that wish.

    69. If the transmittee wishes to have a share transferred to another
        person, the transmittee must execute an instrument of transfer
        in respect of it.

    70. Any transfer made or executed under this Article is to be
        treated as if it were made or executed by the person from whom
        the transmittee has derived rights in respect of the share, and
        as if the event which gave rise to the transmission had not
        occurred.

36. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089555 .anchor}**Transmittees bound by
    prior notices**

    71. If a notice is given to a shareholder in respect of shares and a
        transmittee is entitled to those shares, the transmittee is
        bound by the notice if it was given to the shareholder before
        the transmittee's name has been entered in the register of
        shareholders.

DISTRIBUTIONS

37. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089557 .anchor}**Procedure for declaring
    dividends**

    72. Subject to the Companies Acts, the Regulations and the Articles,
        the Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, and
        the Directors may, provided that such decision is authorised by
        an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, decide to pay
        interim dividends.

    73. For the avoidance of doubt the payment of dividends shall be
        considered to be a transfer of assets other than for full
        consideration and shall not be permitted other than in the
        circumstances prescribed in Article 3.

    74. A dividend must not be declared unless the Directors have made a
        recommendation as to its amount. Such a dividend must not exceed
        the amount recommended by the Directors.

    75. No dividend may be declared or paid unless it is in accordance
        with shareholders' respective rights.

    76. Unless the shareholders' resolution to declare or Directors'
        decision to pay a dividend, or the terms on which shares are
        issued, specify otherwise, it must be paid by reference to each
        shareholder's holding of shares on the date of the resolution or
        decision to declare or pay it.

    77. If the Company's share capital is divided into different
        classes, no interim dividend may be paid on shares carrying
        deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any
        preferential dividend is in arrear.

    78. The Directors may pay at intervals any dividend payable at a
        fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for
        distribution justify the payment.

    79. If the Directors act in good faith, they do not incur any
        liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights
        for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim
        dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights.

38. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089558 .anchor}**Payment of dividends and
    other distributions**

    80. Where a dividend or other sum which is a distribution is payable
        in respect of a share, it must be paid by one or more of the
        following means:

        q.  transfer to a bank or building society account indicated by
            the distribution recipient either in Writing or as the
            Directors may otherwise decide;

        r.  sending a cheque made payable to the distribution recipient
            by post to the distribution recipient at the distribution
            recipient's registered Address (if the distribution
            recipient is a holder of the share), or (in any other case)
            to an Address indicated by the distribution recipient either
            in Writing or as the Directors may otherwise decide;

        s.  sending a cheque made payable to such person by post to such
            person at such Address as the distribution recipient has
            indicated either in Writing or as the Directors may
            otherwise decide; or

        t.  any other means of payment as the Directors agree with the
            distribution recipient either in Writing or by such other
            means as the Directors decide.

    81. In the Articles, "the distribution recipient" means, in respect
        of a share in respect of which a dividend or other sum is
        payable:

        u.  the holder of the share; or

        v.  if the share has two or more joint holders, whichever of
            them is named first in the register of members; or

        w.  if the holder is no longer entitled to the share by reason
            of death or bankruptcy, or otherwise by operation of law,
            the transmittee.

39. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089559 .anchor}**No interest on
    distributions**

    The Company may not pay interest on any dividend or other sum
    payable in respect of a share unless otherwise provided by:

    x.  the terms on which the share was issued; or

    y.  the provisions of another agreement between the holder of that
        share and the Company.

40. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089560 .anchor}**Unclaimed distributions**

    82. All dividends or other sums which are:

        a.  unclaimed after having been declared or become payable,

> may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the
> benefit of the Company until claimed.

83. The payment of any such dividend or other sum into a separate
    account does not make the Company a trustee in respect of it.

84. If:

    b.  twelve years have passed from the date on which a dividend or
        other sum became due for payment; and

    c.  the distribution recipient has not claimed it,

> the distribution recipient is no longer entitled to that dividend or
> other sum and it ceases to remain owing by the Company.

41. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089561 .anchor}**Non-cash distributions**

    85. Subject to the terms of issue of the share in question, the
        Company may, by ordinary resolution on the recommendation of the
        Directors, decide to pay all or part of a dividend or other
        distribution payable in respect of a share by transferring
        non-cash assets of equivalent value (including, without
        limitation, shares or other securities in any company).

    86. For the purposes of paying a non-cash distribution, the
        Directors may make whatever arrangements they think fit,
        including, where any difficulty arises regarding the
        distribution:

        d.  fixing the value of any assets;

        e.  paying cash to any distribution recipient on the basis of
            that value in order to adjust the rights of recipients; and

        f.  vesting any assets in trustees.

42. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089562 .anchor}**Waiver of distributions**

    Distribution recipients may waive their entitlement to a dividend or
    other distribution payable in respect of a share by giving the
    Company notice in Writing to that effect, but if:

    g.  the share has more than one holder; or

    h.  more than one person is entitled to the share, whether by reason
        of the death or bankruptcy of one or more joint holders, or
        otherwise,

    and appropriation of capitalised sums**

    87. Subject to the Articles, the Directors may, if they are so
        authorised by an ordinary resolution:

        i.  decide to capitalise any profits of the Company (whether or
            not they are available for distribution) which are not
            required for paying a preferential dividend, or any sum
            standing to the credit of the Company's share premium
            account or capital redemption reserve; and

        j.  appropriate any sum which they so decide to capitalise (a
            "capitalised sum") to the persons who would have been
            entitled to it if it were distributed by way of dividend
            (the "persons entitled") and in the same proportions.

    88. Capitalised sums must be applied:

        k.  on behalf of the persons entitled; and

        l.  in the same proportions as a dividend would have been
            distributed to them.

    89. Any capitalised sum may be applied in paying up new shares of a
        nominal amount equal to the capitalised sum which are then
        allotted credited as fully paid to the persons entitled or as
        they may direct.

    90. A capitalised sum which was appropriated from profits available
        for distribution may be applied in paying up new debentures of
        the Company which are then allotted credited as fully paid to
        the persons entitled or as they may direct.

    91. Subject to the Articles the Directors may:

        be present, the chairman of the meeting must adjourn it.

    112. The chairman of the meeting may adjourn a general meeting at
        which a quorum is present if:

        v.  the meeting consents to an adjournment; or

        w.  it appears to the chairman of the meeting that an
            adjournment is necessary to protect the safety of any person

    117. A resolution put to the vote of a general meeting must be
        decided on a show of hands unless a poll is duly demanded in
        accordance with the Articles.

    118. A person who is not a shareholder of the Company shall not have
        any right to vote at a general meeting of the Company; but this
        is without prejudice to any right to vote on a resolution
        affecting the rights attached to a class of the Company's
        debentures*.*[^25]

    119. Article 53.2 shall not prevent a person who is a proxy for a
        shareholder or a duly Authorised Representative from voting at a
        general meeting of the Company.

    120. On a vote on a resolution on a show of hands at a meeting every
        person present in person (whether a shareholder, proxy or
        Authorised Representative of a shareholder) and entitled to vote
        shall have a maximum of one vote.

    121. On a vote on a resolution on a poll at a meeting every
        shareholder present in person or by proxy or Authorised
        Representative shall have one vote.

    122. In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands
        or on a poll, the chair of the meeting shall not be entitled to
        a casting vote in addition to any other vote he or she may have.

    123. No shareholder shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting
        unless all monies presently payable by him, her or it to the
        Company have been paid.

    124. The following provisions apply to any organisation that is a
        shareholder ("a Shareholder Organisation"):

        21. a Shareholder Organisation may nominate any individual to
            act as its representative ("an Authorised Representative")
            at any meeting of the Company;

        22. the Shareholder Organisation must give notice in Writing to
            the Company of the name of its Authorised Representative.
            The Authorised Representative will not be entitled to
            represent the Shareholder Organisation at any meeting of the
            Company unless such notice has been received by the Company.
            The Authorised Representative may continue to represent the
            Shareholder Organisation until notice in Writing is received
            by the Company to the contrary;

        23. a Shareholder Organisation may appoint an Authorised
            Representative to represent it at a particular meeting of
            the Company or at all meetings of the Company until notice
            in Writing to the contrary is received by the Company*;*

        24. any notice in Writing received by the Company shall be
            conclusive evidence of the Authorised Representative's
            authority to represent the Shareholder Organisation or that
            his or her authority has been revoked. The Company shall not
            be required to consider whether the Authorised
            Representative has been properly appointed by the
            Shareholder Organisation;

        25. an individual appointed by a Shareholder Organisation to act
            as its Authorised Representative is entitled to exercise (on
            behalf of the Shareholder Organisation) the same powers as
            the Shareholder Organisation could exercise if it were an
            individual shareholder;

        26. on a vote on a resolution at a meeting of the Company, the
            Authorised Representative has the same voting rights as the
            Shareholder Organisation would be entitled to if it was an
            individual shareholder present in person at the meeting; and

        27. the power to appoint an Authorised Representative under this
            Article 53.8 is without prejudice to any rights which the
            Shareholder Organisation has under the Companies Acts and
            the Articles to appoint a proxy or a corporate
            representative

54. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089578 .anchor}**Poll votes**

    125. A poll on a resolution may be demanded:

        b.  in advance of the general meeting where it is to be put to
            the vote; or

        c.  at a general meeting, either before a show of hands on that
            resolution or immediately after the result of a show of
            hands on that resolution is declared.

    126. A poll may be demanded by:

        d.  the chairman of the meeting;

        e.  the Directors;

        f.  two or more persons having the right to vote on the
            resolution;

            or more shareholder having the right to vote at the meeting,
            holds two or more votes; or

        h.  a person or persons representing not less than one tenth of
            the total voting rights of all the shareholders having the
            right to vote on the resolution.

    127. A demand for a poll may be withdrawn if:

        i.  the poll has not yet been taken; and

        j.  the chairman of the meeting consents to the withdrawal.

    128. Polls must be taken immediately and in such manner as the
        chairman of the meeting directs.

55. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089579 .anchor}**Errors and disputes**

    129. No objection may be raised to the qualification of any person
        voting at a general meeting except at the meeting or adjourned
        meeting at which the vote objected to is tendered, and every
        vote not disallowed at the meeting is valid.

    130. Any such objection must be referred to the chairman of the
        meeting, whose decision is final.

56. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089580 .anchor}**Content of Proxy Notices**

    131. Proxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in Writing (a
        "Proxy Notice") which:

        k.  states the name and Address of the shareholder appointing
            the proxy;

        l.  identifies the person appointed to be that shareholder's
            proxy and the general meeting in relation to which that
            person is appointed;

        m.  is signed by or on behalf of the shareholder appointing the
            proxy, or is authenticated in such manner as the Directors
            may determine; and

        n.  is delivered to the Company in accordance with the Articles
            and any instructions contained in the notice of the general
            meeting to which they relate.

    132. The Company may require Proxy Notices to be delivered in a
        particular form, and may specify different forms for different
        purposes.

    133. Proxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is
        to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or
        more resolutions.

    134. Unless a Proxy Notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated
        as:

        o.  allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion
            as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions
            put to the meeting; and

        p.  appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any
            adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as
            well as the meeting itself.

57. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089581 .anchor}**Delivery of Proxy
    Notices**

    135. A person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a
        show of hands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so
        entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment of it,
        even though a valid Proxy Notice has been delivered to the
        Company by or on behalf of that person.

    136. An appointment under a Proxy Notice may be revoked by
        delivering to the Company a notice in Writing given by or on
        behalf of the person by whom or on whose behalf the Proxy Notice
        was given.

    137. A notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if it
        is delivered before the start of the meeting or adjourned
        meeting to which it relates.

    138. If a Proxy Notice is not executed by the person appointing the
        proxy, it must be accompanied by written evidence of the
        authority of the person who executed it to execute it on the
        appointor's behalf.

58. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089582 .anchor}**Amendments to
    resolutions**

    139. An ordinary resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may
        be amended by ordinary resolution if:

        q.  notice of the proposed amendment is given to the Company in
            Writing by a person entitled to vote at the general meeting
            at which it is to be proposed not less than 48 hours before
            the meeting is to take place (or such later time as the
            chairman of the meeting may determine); and

        r.  the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion
            of the chairman of the meeting, materially alter the scope
            of the resolution.

    140. A special resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be
        amended by ordinary resolution, if:

        s.  the chairman of the meeting proposes the amendment at the
            general meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed;
            and

        t.  the amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to
            correct a grammatical or other non-substantive error in the
            resolution.

    141. If the chairman of the meeting, acting in good faith, wrongly
        decides that an amendment to a resolution is out of order, the
        chairman's error does not invalidate the vote on that
        resolution.

59. []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089584 .anchor}**Written resolutions **

            of eligible shareholders.

        29. A written resolution is passed as a special resolution if it
            is passed by shareholders representing not less than 75% of
            the total voting rights of eligible shareholders. A written
            resolution is not a special resolution unless it states that
            it was proposed as a special resolution.

    143. In relation to a resolution proposed as a written resolution of
        the Company the eligible shareholders are the shareholders who
        would have been entitled to vote on the resolution on the

    144. A shareholders' resolution under the Companies Acts removing a
        Director or an auditor before the expiration of his or her term
        of office may not be passed as a written resolution.

    145. A copy of the written resolution must be sent to every
        shareholder together with a statement informing the shareholder
        how to signify their agreement to the resolution and the date by
        which the resolution must be passed if it is not to lapse.
        Communications in relation to written notices shall be sent to
        the Company's auditors in accordance with the Companies Acts.

    146. A shareholder signifies their agreement to a proposed written
        resolution when the Company receives from him or her an
        authenticated Document identifying the resolution to which it
        relates and indicating his or her agreement to the resolution.

        30. If the Document is sent to the Company in Hard Copy Form, it
            is authenticated if it bears the shareholder's signature.

        31. If the Document is sent to the Company by Electronic Means,
            it is authenticated \[if it bears the shareholder's
            signature\] or \[if the identity of the shareholder is
            confirmed in a manner agreed by the Directors\] or \[if it
            is accompanied by a statement of the identity of the
            shareholder and the Company has no reason to doubt the truth
            of that statement\] or \[if it is from an email Address
            notified by the shareholder to the Company for the purposes
            of receiving Documents or information by Electronic Means\].

    147. A written resolution is passed when the required majority of
        eligible shareholders have signified their agreement to it.

    148. A proposed written resolution lapses if it is not passed within
        28 days beginning with the Circulation Date.

    []{#__RefHeading___Toc242089594 .anchor}***Explanatory Notes : CIC
    Limited by Shares, Schedule 3, Large Membership***

[^1]: On articles of association generally, see \[Part 5\] of the
    Regulator's information and guidance notes. If you are an existing
    company wishing to become a community interest company, there is no
    need to adopt completely new articles, but you must comply with the
    requirements of the Regulations by including the provisions set out
    in Schedule 3 to the Regulations in the articles of your company.

[^2]: See \[Part 6\] of the Regulator's information and guidance notes.
    Inclusion of the provisions contained in articles 3.1 to 3.3
    (reflecting sub-paragraphs (1) and (3) of paragraph 1 of Schedule 3
    of the Regulations) is mandatory.

[^3]: When a CIC is wound up, its "residual assets" are any property
    remaining after satisfaction of the company's liabilities under the
    Insolvency Act 1986. The Regulations permit shareholders to be paid
    back, out of the residual assets, the nominal value of their shares.
    Anything left over after this process is classed as "remaining
    residual assets" and must be paid to a specified Asset Locked Body
    (or, if no such body is specified, to an Asset Locked Body chosen by
    the Regulator in consultation with the company).

[^4]: See regulation 23 of the Regulations and \[Parts 6 and 10\] of the
    Regulator's information and guidance notes. If the company does not
    specify that the remaining residual assets are to be transferred to
    a particular Asset Locked Body, an appropriate recipient will be
    chosen by the Regulator, in consultation with the company's
    directors and shareholders.

[^5]: On the specification of the company's objects, see \[Part 5\] of
    the Regulator's information and guidance notes.

[^6]: On limited liability and share capital generally, see \[Part 3\]
    of the Regulator's information and guidance notes.

[^7]: Articles 11 and 12 permit the directors to delegate any of their
    functions. Delegation may take the form of, for instance, the
    directors giving a managing director general authority to run the
    company's day to day business, or responsibility for specific
    matters being delegated to particular directors (e.g. financial
    matters to a finance director). However, it may be equally
    appropriate to delegate matters to persons other than directors. In
    all cases, it is important to remember that delegation does not
    absolve directors of their general duties towards the company and
    their overall responsibility for its management. This means, amongst
    other things, that directors must be satisfied that those to whom
    responsibilities are delegated are competent to carry them out.

[^8]: Article 13 states that the directors must make decisions by
    majority at a meeting in accordance with article 15; or unanimously
    if taken in accordance with article 19.

[^9]: Article 15.2 is designed to facilitate the taking of decisions by
    the directors communicating via telephone or video conference calls.
    Note the requirement to keep a written record of meetings and
    decisions (article 62).

[^10]: The quorum may be fixed in absolute terms (e.g. "two directors")
    or as a proportion of the total number of directors (e.g. "one third
    of the total number of directors"). You may even wish to stipulate
    that particular named directors, or directors representing
    particular stakeholder interests, must be present to constitute a
    quorum.

[^11]: Article 18 reflects paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations,
    which is required to be included in the articles of all community
    interest companies.

[^12]: You may wish to include a provision which gives the chair of the
    board a casting vote. This will enable the directors to resolve any
    deadlock at board level.

[^13]: Article 19 is designed to facilitate the taking of decisions by
    directors following discussions in the form of, for example, email
    exchanges copied to all the directors. Note the requirements as to
    recording the decision in articles 19.2 and 48.

[^14]: The provisions in articles 20 and 21 reflect the position under
    the Companies Act 2006. However, it is recommended that, as a matter
    of good practice, all actual and potential conflicts of interest are
    disclosed in writing or at a meeting, as the case may be.

[^15]: Private companies are obliged to have at least one director.
    Provisions can be inserted into the articles providing for a minimum
    number of directors. Where the company has just one director, that
    director must be a natural person. You may wish to consider whether
    provision should also be made for a maximum number of directors
    (e.g. "and the total number of directors in office at any one time
    shall not exceed four"). While it is often important to ensure
    proper representation of a number of different groups on a board of
    directors, very large boards can become unwieldy and a maximum
    number of directors provision may help to guard against this.

[^16]: The board of directors cannot remove a director other than in
    accordance with the provisions in article 24 and the Companies Act
    2006. The shareholders may, of course, vote to remove a director
    appointed by the directors.

[^17]: See the guidance on directors' remuneration in \[Part 9\] of the
    Regulator's information and guidance notes.

[^18]: If the company does not have a common seal, share certificates
    can be executed by two directors, by one director and the secretary
    (if there is one), or by one director in the presence of an
    independent witness.

[^19]: Articles 32.5 to 32.8 are mandatory, reflecting paragraph 2 of
    Schedule 3 to the Regulations. However, the model constitution does
    not contain any other restrictions on the transfer of shares. Note
    that the directors may refuse to register a transfer to persons of
    whom they do not approve.

[^20]: E.g. the standard stock transfer form prescribed under the Stock
    Transfer Act 1963.

[^21]: This article in itself does not provide sufficient authority for
    the company to purchase its own shares. The Company must also comply
    with the relevant statutory requirements, in particular sections 693
    -- 700 of the Companies Act 2006. We recommend that you take legal
    advice before taking any steps towards the company purchasing its
    own shares. It is important that any purchase of shares made in
    accordance with this article is also made in accordance with article
    3 (asset lock).

[^22]: In the event of the death of a shareholder, the share will pass
    according to the will of the deceased shareholder, or the intestacy
    rules.

[^23]: The Companies Act 2006 has removed the need for private companies
    to hold annual general meetings and therefore these Articles follow
    suit; however, if you wish, you can insert an additional provision
    which obliges the company to hold annual general meetings.

[^24]: Article 44.2 provides that general meetings must be held in
    accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. You must
    specify how many shareholders are required to be present to hold a
    valid general meeting. The quorum may be fixed in absolute terms
    (e.g. "four shareholders") or as a proportion of the total number of
    shareholders (e.g. "three quarters of the shareholders from time to
