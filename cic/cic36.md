|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This will provide relief and      |
|                                   | assistance to community members   |
|                                   | in the important and potentially  |
|                                   | time-consuming tasks of kitchen   |
|                                   | stock management and ingredient   |
|                                   | shopping.                         |

|                                   | At present this kind of planning  |
|                                   | can and is often done on paper,   |
|                                   | and there are for-profit          |
|                                   | businesses which are starting to  |
|                                   | provide similar online meal       |
|                                   | planning tools.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | OpenCulinary differentiates       |
|                                   | itself by taking a strong stance  |
|                                   | on privacy. All user data is      |
|                                   | stored on user's own devices and  |
|                                   | is never shared -- letalone sold  |
|                                   | -- to the service or any third    |
|                                   | party. This follows a set of      |
|                                   | principles for developing         |
|                                   | 'local-first software'.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Over time we believe that         |
|                                   | building tools which strongly     |
|                                   | respect user privacy will provide |
|                                   | both a great service to the       |
|                                   | community and also build their    |
|                                   | deserved trust and feedback,      |
|                                   | leading to further improvements.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The service will allow users to   |
|                                   | 'send' the shopping list for      |
|                                   | their meal plan to online         |
|                                   | supermarkets in order to arrange  |
|                                   | deliveries *if they choose to*,   |
|                                   | but this will always be opt-in    |
|                                   | and the service will always       |
|                                   | provide meal planning without the |
|                                   | need to create any user accounts  |
|                                   | or deal with any third-party food |
|                                   | suppliers.                        |
