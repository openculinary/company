Overview
--------
This document is an access assessment performed by following guidance[1] from OFCOM, the UK regulator of the Online Safety Act, legislation for which RecipeRadar is in scope as a Part 3 (search service) provider.

Responses
---------

1. Can children normally access the service, or part of the service?   [Y]

2. Is the child user condition met?

  a) Is my service, or part of my service, of a kind likely to attract
     a significant number of children?                                 [Y*]

  b) Is there a significant number of children who are users of my
     service, or part of my service?                                   [Y*]


  * In truth, we do not know what percentage of our userbase is children, and
    we would prefer not to use what we would consider to be intrusive or
    off-putting methods with outweighing potential negative externalities in
    order to determine that.  We do think that some children could effectively
    use the service, either with their parents or independently.  Given the
    unknowns and belief in potential benefits, we acknowledge that surveying
    relevant risks is sensible, and respond 'yes' to both questions to require
    ourselves to follow a Children's Risk Assessment of the service.
