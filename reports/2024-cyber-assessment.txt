RecipeRadar - 2024 Cyber Assessment
-----------------------------------

This document is an assessment of RecipeRadar (developed and operated by
OpenCulinary C.I.C.) as of December 2024 using version v3.2 of the UK NCSC
Cyber Assessment Framework[1].

As a small project, RecipeRadar may benefit from a relatively agile technology
infrastructure/computing base.  However, the company is also to some extent
restricted by its technology selection principles (e.g. primarily open-source).

Evaluation
----------

A1: Governance

A1.a: The organization's network and information security approach is owned and managed at the directorial level and is regularly top-of-mind.  However, we do not have a written policy, and as a single-employee organization, there is no guarantee that we would be able to communicate and share the current approach effectively.
