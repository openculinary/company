RecipeRadar - 2024 Cyber Assessment
-----------------------------------

This document is an assessment of RecipeRadar (developed and operated by
OpenCulinary C.I.C.) as of December 2024 using version v3.2 of the UK NCSC
Cyber Assessment Framework[1].

As a small project, RecipeRadar may benefit from a relatively agile technology
infrastructure/computing base.  However, the company is also to some extent
restricted by its technology selection principles (e.g. primarily open-source).
